# Zodiacal Light: An Accidental Zodiac?

## About This Project

This pilot project aims to combine chance operations, surrealist methodology, and algorithmic decision-making to generate imaginary zodiac constellations. As part of a short interactive poetic experience users choose prompts (Read, Talk, Make, Dream) to discover small hybrid creatures created either by AI or by human. These can then be downloaded and printed, encouraging movement between the digital to the physical.

This project explores the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence collaboration, treating code as a medium for poetry and asking questions about authorship, agency, and the collaborative potential of AI tools in creative practice.

## Academic Context

This work is part of an MDes module at the **University of Sunderland**, which explores the use of new technologies in graphic design.

**Status:** Work in progress - this version represents the foundational structure. Future development will include:

- Dual-path system offering human-created collage artwork vs AI-generated prompts
- Downloadable PDF artifacts (printable constellation creatures)
- Chance-based algorithms drawing from vintage texts and time-sensitive data sources

Further post-pilot iterations hope to include ways that printed-out objects can be re-transformed into the digital and back again, creating a chance-led 'chain' of domain-changes which blurs lines between abstract and material.

## Technical Notes

For those interested in the technical implementation: This is a single-page HTML application with embedded CSS and JavaScript. The branching logic maps user choices through a decision tree to one of twelve possible constellation outcomes. No external libraries are used, making it lightweight and accessible.
